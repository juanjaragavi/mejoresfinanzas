# Project Guidelines

## Documentation Requirements

- Update relevant documentation in `src/lib/documents/DOCUMENTATION.md` when modifying features
- Keep `README.md` in sync with new capabilities
- Maintain changelog entries in `/CHANGELOG.md`

## Project Awareness & Context

- Always read `2-PLANNING.md` at the start of a new conversation to understand the project's architecture, goals, style, and constraints.
- Check and update `3-TASKS.md` before starting a new task. If the task isn’t listed, add it with a brief description and today's date.
- Refer to `4-PUSH-AND-COMMIT.md` for commit and push guidelines.
- Review `5-BRANDING.md` for branding guidelines, including color palette, typography, and voice/tone.

## Architecture Decision Records

Create ADRs in `src/lib/documents/ADRs.md` for:

- Major dependency changes
- Architectural pattern changes
- New integration patterns

## Package Manager

This project uses **pnpm** as the Node.js package manager. Always use `pnpm` commands instead of `npm` or `yarn`.

### Common Commands

- **Install dependencies**: `pnpm install`
- **Add new dependency**: `pnpm add <package-name>`
- **Add development dependency**: `pnpm add -D <package-name>`
- **Remove dependency**: `pnpm remove <package-name>`
- **Run scripts**: `pnpm run <script-name>` or `pnpm <script-name>`
- **Update dependencies**: `pnpm update`

### Available Scripts

- `pnpm dev` - Start development server
- `pnpm build` - Build for production
- `pnpm preview` - Preview production build
- `pnpm check` - Run Astro checks
- `pnpm format` - Format code with Prettier
- `pnpm workflow` - Run git workflow script
- `pnpm sync` - Sync with main branch
- `pnpm deploy` - Deploy to production

### Why pnpm?

- **Disk efficiency**: Shared dependencies across projects
- **Speed**: Faster installations than npm/yarn
- **Strict**: Better dependency resolution
- **Workspace support**: Excellent monorepo capabilities

## Code Style & Patterns

- Generate API clients using OpenAPI Generator
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Use repository pattern for data access

## Testing Standards

- Unit tests required for business logic
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- E2E tests for critical user flows

## Tool Usage

A suite of MCP Server tools is available for your use. These tools should be employed as needed to perform various tasks.

### MCP Server Discovery

To identify available MCP Servers, utilize the `@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem` to read the configuration file located at:
`/Users/macbookpro/Library/Application Support/Code/User/globalStorage/saoudrizwan.claude-dev/settings/cline_mcp_settings.json`

This will provide you with a complete list of configured MCP servers and their capabilities.

### Astro Project Documentation

As this is an Astro project, before executing any task related to the structure of the project, you should use the `@upstash/context7-mcp@latest` MCP server tool to look for Astro documentation in <https://docs.astro.build/en/getting-started/>. This will ensure you have the most up-to-date information about Astro's patterns, conventions, and best practices.

### Effective Tool Selection

Analyze the capabilities of these tools to determine the most appropriate approach for your tasks.

**Note**: When running any Node.js commands or scripts, always use `pnpm` instead of `npm` or `yarn` as this project uses pnpm as the package manager.

## Primary LLM Starter Prompt

When starting a new site with this template, fill and provide the Starter Prompt to your LLM agent:

- `lib/documents/LLM_STARTER_PROMPT.md`

The prompt defines brand, description, color palette, typography, desired features, integrations, and environment assumptions to streamline setup.

## LLM Agent Checklist

1. Read `.clinerules/2-PLANNING.md`, `.clinerules/1-RULES.md`, and `.clinerules/5-BRANDING.md`.
2. Log the task in `.clinerules/3-TASKS.md` with today’s date.
3. Use pnpm exclusively; assume the dev server at <http://localhost:4322>.
4. After each iteration, run functional, UI/UX, integration, and performance checks.
5. Update `src/lib/documents/DOCUMENTATION.md`, `README.md`, and `CHANGELOG.md` for any changes.
6. Create ADRs in `src/lib/documents/ADRs.md` for major decisions.

## Development Workflow

### Development Server Assumption

**Always assume the development server is running** unless explicitly told otherwise. The development server is typically started with `pnpm dev` and runs on `http://localhost:4322` for Astro projects.

### Post-Iteration Testing

After completing any successful development iteration (code changes, feature additions, bug fixes), **immediately initiate testing** to verify the changes work as expected. This includes:

- **Functional Testing**: Verify the implemented features work correctly
- **UI/UX Testing**: Check visual elements, responsiveness, and user interactions
- **Integration Testing**: Ensure new changes don't break existing functionality
- **Performance Testing**: Confirm changes don't negatively impact site performance

Testing should be done proactively without waiting for user prompts, as part of the standard development cycle quality assurance.

## Push and Commit Guidelines

### Trigger

This procedure is initiated when the user issues the prompt "Push and commit our latest changes." following a successful development cycle.

#### Steps

1. **Initialize Commit Message File**:
   Clear the contents of the @/lib/documents/commit-message.txt file.

2. **Verify Codebase Status**:
   Query the current status of the codebase using your `git_status` MCP server with the following request body:

   ```json
   {
     "repo_path": "/Users/macbookpro/GitHub/financial-blog-template"
   }
   ```

3. **Formulate Commit Message**:
   Populate the @/lib/documents/commit-message.txt file with a message that accurately describes the latest modifications.

4. **Execute Workflow Script**:
   Run the `pnpm workflow` command to execute the workflow automation script.

## Agent Authoring Directive

- Whenever the agent is prompted to generate a new blog post or article for this template site:
  - First, review `lib/documents/blog-post-generation-prompt.md` to follow the latest content generation rules and US localisation requirements.
  - Also consult `lib/documents/topfinanzas-us-topic-outline.csv` to determine article type (pillar vs cluster), tentative title, content focus, and related cluster/pillar context.
  - Use the US sitemap at `dist/sitemap-index.xml` to avoid duplicating already published content and to build correct internal links.
  - Produce content in US English conventions (en-US) and ensure internal links point to your configured domain.
  - If the funnel stage is TOFU, create the new blog post under `src/pages/personal-finance`, matching the structure and layout used by existing articles in that directory, but write entirely new, original content.

## Blog Post Listing Integration Requirements

After creating any new blog post or article, **ensure the content appears in all relevant listing pages** across the website for optimal discoverability and user experience.

### Critical Blog Listing Pages

**Always verify new articles appear in:**

1. **Homepage** (`src/pages/index.astro`):
   - Latest News section (most recent 3 articles)
   - Featured Article section (top article by date)
   - Featured Posts section (articles 2-4 from collection)

2. **Main Blog Hub** (`src/pages/blog/index.astro`):
   - All Articles section with category filtering
   - Aggregated content display from personal-finance and financial-solutions collections

3. **Category-Specific Index Pages**:
   - Personal Finance: `/personal-finance/` (`src/pages/personal-finance/index.astro`)
   - Financial Solutions: `/financial-solutions/` (`src/pages/financial-solutions/index.astro`)

4. **Pagination Systems**:
   - Main blog pagination: `/blog/page/[slug].astro`
   - Personal finance pagination: `/personal-finance/page/[slug].astro`
   - Financial solutions pagination: `/financial-solutions/page/[slug].astro`

5. **Category Filtering**:

### Technical Architecture

**Blog listing functionality depends on:**

- `getSinglePage()` content parser function
- `sortByDate()` chronological sorting utility
- `PaginatedPosts` component for rendering
- Astro content collections system
- Proper frontmatter structure with valid dates and categories

### Post-Publication Verification Protocol

**Required checks after creating new content:**

1. **Development Server Verification**: Confirm article appears in homepage latest articles section
2. **Category Page Validation**: Verify article displays in appropriate category listing page
3. **Filter System Testing**: Test category filtering includes the new article correctly
4. **Pagination Integrity**: Ensure pagination system updates to accommodate new content
5. **Cross-Section Linking**: Validate internal links and content cross-references

### Content Integration Troubleshooting

**Common issues preventing article visibility:**

- **Future Dates**: Articles with future publication dates are filtered out by the content system
- **Invalid Date Format**: Date must follow `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ` ISO format exactly
- **Incorrect Categories**: Category names must match existing category structure
- **Missing Frontmatter**: Required metadata fields (title, description, date, categories) must be complete
- **Wrong Directory**: File must be placed in correct content collection directory (`src/content/personal-finance/` or `src/content/financial-solutions/`)

**Note**: The listing system automatically integrates new content when properly formatted markdown files are created with valid frontmatter and placed in the correct content collection directories.
