The 50/30/20 rule is a simple way to budget without micromanaging every purchase. Split your after‑tax income into three buckets to balance today and tomorrow.

## The rule at a glance

- 50% Needs: essentials you can’t skip
- 30% Wants: lifestyle choices you enjoy
- 20% Savings/Debt: your future security

## What fits in each bucket

### Needs (50%)

Rent or mortgage, utilities, basic internet/phone, groceries, insurance premiums, transportation, and minimum debt payments.

### Wants (30%)

Dining out, entertainment/streaming, travel, hobbies, non‑essential shopping, and upgrades.

### Savings and debt (20%)

Emergency fund, retirement accounts, short‑term goals (e.g., down payment), extra debt payments, and investments.

Tip: If high‑interest debt (like credit cards) is in the mix, prioritize eliminating it before investing heavily.

## Put it into practice

1. Calculate take‑home pay (average a few months if income varies).
2. Run the math: 50% needs, 30% wants, 20% savings/debt.
3. Compare to recent spending and adjust where you’re off‑target.
4. Automate bill pay and savings transfers to stay consistent.
5. Review monthly and tweak as life changes.

## Keep it sustainable

This method works because it’s flexible. If housing is high, you might temporarily run 55/25/20 while you optimize. Progress beats perfection.
