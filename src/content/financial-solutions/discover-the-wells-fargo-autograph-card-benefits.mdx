Versatile rewards for every purchase with no annual fee and valuable benefits.

- **Earn 3x points** on restaurants, travel, gas stations, streaming services, and phone plans.
- **Earn 1x point** on all other purchases.
- **No annual fee** - ever.
- **$300 welcome bonus** after spending $1,500 in the first 3 months.

The Wells Fargo Autograph Card offers a balanced rewards structure that makes it easy to earn on everyday purchases. With bonus categories covering dining, travel, gas, streaming, and phone services, plus a generous welcome bonus, it's designed for modern spending habits.

### 3x Points on Popular Categories: Maximize Your Daily Spending

The Wells Fargo Autograph Card shines with its 3x points earning structure across five popular spending categories. Whether you're dining out, booking travel, filling up at gas stations, enjoying streaming services, or paying your phone bill, every dollar earns triple points.

For example, spending $200 monthly on dining and $100 on gas earns 900 points each monthâ€”that's 10,800 points annually from just these two categories. This broad category coverage ensures you're earning enhanced rewards on purchases you're already making, without having to track rotating categories or activation requirements.

The card's approach to bonus categories reflects modern spending patterns, recognizing that consumers frequently spend on digital services and everyday essentials. This makes it particularly valuable for younger cardholders and tech-savvy users who prioritize streaming and mobile services.

### $300 Welcome Bonus: Strong Start to Your Rewards Journey

New cardholders can earn a substantial $300 welcome bonus after spending $1,500 within the first three months of account opening. This requirement is reasonable and achievable for most households through normal spending patterns.

The welcome bonus provides immediate value and can be redeemed for cash back, statement credits, or travel. This upfront reward effectively covers several months' worth of spending benefits, making the card attractive from day one. Combined with ongoing category bonuses, the welcome offer provides strong initial motivation to use the card regularly.

### 1x Points on Everything Else: No Spending Goes Unrewarded

Beyond the bonus categories, the Wells Fargo Autograph Card earns 1x point on all other purchases, ensuring every transaction contributes to your rewards balance. This universal earning rate means you can use the card for any purchase without sacrificing rewards potential.

Whether you're shopping for groceries, buying clothes, paying utilities, or making unexpected purchases, you'll always earn points. This comprehensive earning structure eliminates the need to carry multiple cards or worry about which card to use for different purchase types.

### No Annual Fee: Keep More of Your Rewards

The Wells Fargo Autograph Card comes with no annual fee, ever. This means 100% of your earned rewards translate to actual value without any offset from annual costs. Unlike premium cards that charge annual fees, every point you earn with the Autograph Card represents pure benefit.

The absence of an annual fee makes the card suitable for any spending level. Whether you're a light spender who values simplicity or a heavy spender maximizing rewards, you won't face ongoing costs that diminish your rewards value. This fee structure ensures the card remains beneficial regardless of how your spending patterns change over time.

### Flexible Redemption Options: Your Rewards, Your Way

Points earned with the Wells Fargo Autograph Card can be redeemed in multiple ways to suit your preferences. Options include cash back, statement credits, travel bookings, gift cards, and merchandise. This flexibility ensures your rewards can adapt to changing needs and preferences.

The redemption process is straightforward through Wells Fargo's online portal or mobile app. Whether you prefer immediate cash back to offset purchases or want to save points for larger redemptions, the card accommodates different reward strategies.

### Additional Card Benefits: Enhanced Value Beyond Rewards

Beyond earning rewards, the Wells Fargo Autograph Card includes valuable additional benefits. Cardholders enjoy cell phone protection when paying their monthly bill with the card, providing coverage against damage and theft up to $600 per claim.

The card also includes zero liability protection for unauthorized transactions, ensuring peace of mind for everyday use. These additional benefits add practical value beyond the rewards program, making the card a comprehensive financial tool for daily spending.

### Perfect for Everyday Spending

The Wells Fargo Autograph Card combines strong bonus categories, a generous welcome offer, and no annual fee to create an attractive package for everyday spending. Its broad 3x categories ensure you'll earn enhanced rewards on common expenses, while the 1x rate on everything else means no purchase goes unrewarded. Before applying, review the eligibility requirements to ensure you can take full advantage of these benefits.
