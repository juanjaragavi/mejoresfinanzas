### 1.5% Unlimited Cash Back: Earn on Every Purchase

The Capital One Quicksilver Student Credit Card offers an impressive 1.5% cash back on every purchase with no restrictions or rotating categories. This straightforward rewards structure makes it easy for students to earn on all their spending - from textbooks and dining to gas and entertainment.

For example, spending $500 a month earns $7.50 in cash back - that's $90 annually that can be used for statement credits or direct deposits. Unlike many student cards that offer limited or tiered rewards, this card ensures every purchase contributes to your cash back earnings.

### No Foreign Transaction Fees: Perfect for Study Abroad

One of the standout features for students is the absence of foreign transaction fees. Whether you're studying abroad for a semester or traveling internationally, you won't pay extra fees on purchases made outside the United States.

This feature can save students significant money when traveling or studying internationally, where foreign transaction fees typically range from 2.7% to 3% per transaction. For a $1,000 study abroad expense, you could save $30 in fees alone.

### Credit-Building Tools: Establish Strong Financial Habits

The Capital One mobile app provides excellent tools to help students build credit responsibly. Features include credit score monitoring, spending tracking, and budgeting tools that help students understand their financial habits and improve their credit profile.

Students can set up account alerts, monitor their credit utilization, and access educational resources about credit management. These tools are invaluable for young adults learning to manage credit responsibly and establish a strong financial foundation.

### Student-Specific Features and Protections

The card includes special considerations for students, such as more flexible approval criteria for those with limited credit history. Capital One understands that students are just beginning their credit journey and may not have extensive credit backgrounds.

Additionally, the card offers responsible credit practices education and tools specifically designed to help students learn good financial habits from the start of their credit-building journey.
