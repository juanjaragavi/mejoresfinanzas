### No Credit Score Required: Your Path to Credit Building Starts Here

The Tomo Credit Card breaks down traditional barriers by not requiring an existing credit history. Instead, it evaluates your financial stability based on your income and spending habits. This innovative approach makes it perfect for recent immigrants, international students, and anyone new to the credit system, providing a clear pathway to build a positive credit profile from scratch. It's about giving everyone a fair chance to prove their financial responsibility.

### Flexible Cashback Rewards (1% to 20%): Earn While You Spend

One of the most appealing features of the Tomo Credit Card is its flexible cashback program, offering 1% to 20% back, especially with select partners. This is a rare and valuable benefit for a card designed for credit building. By using your Tomo Card for everyday expenses like groceries and transportation, especially with participating merchants, you can maximize your rewards while consistently building a positive payment history. It's a win-win: you save money and strengthen your credit.

### No Annual Fees or Interest Charges: Keep More of Your Money

Tomo is committed to helping you achieve financial health without hidden costs. The card charges no annual fees and, uniquely, no interest charges. This is achieved through a weekly or biweekly payment system that encourages timely payments and prevents debt accumulation. This model promotes responsible spending habits and ensures that the card remains affordable, allowing you to build credit without the burden of high-interest debt.

### Credit Limit Based on Income: Grow Responsibly

Your Tomo Credit Card limit is determined by your income and financial activity, rather than your credit history. This personalized approach ensures your limit aligns with your capacity to spend responsibly. As you consistently use the card and make timely payments, your credit limit can gradually increase, supporting your credit-building journey within a safe and manageable range. It's a system designed for growth and financial empowerment.

### Tips to Maximize Your Tomo Credit Card Benefits

To get the most out of your Tomo Credit Card, consider these practical tips:

- **Set Reminders for Weekly Payments:** Tomo's payment structure requires regular, timely payments. Set up reminders or enable auto-pay to ensure you never miss a deadline, which is crucial for building a strong credit history.
- **Use the Card for Essential Purchases:** Leverage the cashback rewards by using your Tomo Card for your regular expenses, especially with partner vendors. This helps you earn rewards on spending you'd do anyway.
- **Monitor Your Spending:** Since your credit limit is tied to your income, keeping your spending within reasonable limits can improve your chances of future credit limit increases and demonstrate responsible financial management.
- **Track Your Credit Progress:** Regularly check your credit score to see the positive impact of your responsible Tomo Card usage. Watching your score grow can be a great motivator!

### Final Thoughts on the Tomo Credit Card

The Tomo Credit Card is a powerful tool for anyone looking to build or improve their credit responsibly. By focusing on your U.S. bank account activity rather than traditional credit history, Tomo makes credit accessible to a wider audience. With no credit score requirements, flexible cashback rewards, and zero interest charges, it's designed to support your financial health and lay a solid foundation for your credit future.
