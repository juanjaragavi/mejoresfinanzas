The TD FlexPay Credit Card offers several compelling features and benefits designed to enhance your financial management:

- **Flexible Payment Options:** The flexibility offered by TD FlexPay is one of its primary draws. Whether you’re handling a high-value purchase or managing regular expenses, you have control over your repayment schedule, allowing for adaptable financial planning.

### Understanding Interest Rates and Fees

To make an informed decision about the TD FlexPay Credit Card, here’s a look at some typical fees and interest rates:

- **Annual Percentage Rate (APR):** The card offers a competitive APR, which is determined based on the applicant’s creditworthiness. This APR dictates how much interest accumulates on any unpaid balances.
