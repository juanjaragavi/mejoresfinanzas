> Template note: Adjust examples to your BRAND and routing preferences. Links and code samples retained as-is.

## 📊 Issue Summary

**Error**: "Duplicada: el usuario no ha indicado ninguna versión canónica" (Duplicate: user has not specified a canonical version)
**Pages Affected**: 31 pages (as of August 4, 2025)
**Impact**: Pages not being indexed by Google due to missing canonical URLs

## 🔍 Root Causes Identified

### 1. Missing Canonical URLs

- **Inconsistent implementation**: Some pagination pages had canonicals, others didn't

### 2. URL Structure Inconsistencies

- **Trailing slash conflicts**: URLs appearing both with and without trailing slashes
- **Configuration mismatch**: Site configured for no trailing slashes but some canonicals had them

### 3. Ad Network URLs Being Indexed

- **Ad management URLs**: `/YOUR_NETWORK_CODE/*` and `/23062212598/*` paths were being indexed
- **Should be blocked**: These URLs serve no SEO purpose and create indexation noise

## ✅ Solutions Implemented

### 2. Fixed Trailing Slash Consistency

**Configuration**: `trailing_slash: false` in `config.json`
**Action**: Removed trailing slashes from all canonical URLs to match site configuration

**Files Updated**:

- `/src/pages/blog/page/[slug].astro`
- `/src/pages/finanzas-personales/page/[slug].astro`
- `/src/pages/soluciones-financieras/page/[slug].astro`

### 3. Blocked Ad Network URLs in robots.txt

**File**: `/public/robots.txt`

```robots
# Block ad network URLs that shouldn't be indexed
Disallow: /YOUR_NETWORK_CODE/
Disallow: /23062212598/
```
