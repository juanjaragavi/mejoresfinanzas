feat: Implement Spanish URL slugs for SEO optimization

- Update main navigation menu to use Spanish URLs (/finanzas-personales, /soluciones-financieras)
- Implement proper Spanish routing structure with canonical URLs for SEO
- Add redirects from English URLs to Spanish URLs for existing traffic
- Update all internal cross-references between blog sections to use Spanish URLs
- Configure canonical URLs for all Spanish pages and pagination
- Fix Base layout integration for Spanish single post pages
- Ensure proper metadata and SEO optimization for Spanish routes

Spanish URL Structure:
- /personal-finance → /finanzas-personales (with 301 redirect)
- /financial-solutions → /soluciones-financieras (with 301 redirect)

This implementation provides better SEO targeting for Hispanic US users while maintaining existing English URL accessibility through redirects.
