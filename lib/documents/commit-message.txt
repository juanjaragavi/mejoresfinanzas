chore: rename project references from financial-blog-template to mejoresfinanzas
feat(localization): implement Spanish (es-US) content & routing layer with automated slugs, redirects, and docs

Summary:
- Added automated Spanish localization for Personal Finance & Financial Solutions content (frontmatter lang + publish).
- Generated Spanish slugs & mapping (slug-mapping.json) and rewrote internal links.
- Introduced Spanish route layers: /finanzas-personales, /soluciones-financieras (index, single, pagination) preserving original collection IDs.
- Added Netlify 301 redirects (wildcard + per-post) from legacy English category paths.
- Updated sitemap config recognition for localized hubs (already listing Spanish routes) and verified successful build (150 pages).
- Added translation glossary and updated README, CHANGELOG, DOCUMENTATION with localization details.

Next steps (not in this commit): finalize manual translation polish, normalize remaining English-heavy slugs, add hreflang/canonical pairing, implement language switcher.
Updated all hardcoded paths, names, and service identifiers after repository rename.

Changes:
- Update repo path in push/commit procedure docs (.clinerules & .github instructions & GEMINI.md)
- Rename PM2 app & cwd in ecosystem.config.js and deploy script; adjust dev sync script path
- Adjust local path references in SEO_ROBOTS_LLMS_IMPLEMENTATION.md
- Update links and repo references in public/llms.txt
- Update theme-name meta tag in Base.astro
- Update Chrome DevTools workspace root JSON

No functional code changes besides metadata/name updates. Build & runtime behavior should remain identical.
