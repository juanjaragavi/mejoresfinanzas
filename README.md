Note: The placeholder logo above references a legacy CDN path to preserve working asset links during templating. Swap this image in-place under `public/images/logo.png` when you brand your site.

This repository is an Astro-based financial content platform. It started from a brand-agnostic template and is now branded as MejoresFinanzas. Update textual brand data via `src/config/brand.ts` and `src/config/config.json`. Media assets can be swapped later without breaking paths.

Branding defaults:

- Primary color is a neutral blue (`#4A90E2`) defined in `src/config/theme.json` and exposed via `var(--color-primary)`.
- The homepage banner title reads from `BRAND.tagline` with a fallback to ‚ÄúSlogan or Tagline‚Äù. Clear `banner.title` in `src/content/homepage/-index.md` to use the fallback.

## Key Features

- 10+ pre-designed pages and listing/pagination
- Credit Card quiz scaffolding and shortcodes
- Mobile-optimized layouts and typography
- TOFU/MOFU-ready content structure

## License

MIT ‚Äî see `LICENSE`.

Original image URLs are kept to avoid breaking paths; replace them manually as needed.

## Template Customization (for LLM Agents and humans)

- Edit `src/config/brand.ts` to set:
  - name: your brand display name
  - domain: primary domain (mejoresfinanzas.com)
  - tagline: short text-only tagline
- Do not change existing media URLs during initial setup; swap files at the same paths later.
- Update `src/config/config.json`, `src/config/theme.json`, and styles as needed. Add your logos under `public/images/` using existing filenames to avoid code changes.

Sample content lives under `src/content`. For Personal Finance we now ship 6 cornerstone, interlinked posts to keep listings clean and focused. Add new content as needed and ensure frontmatter is valid so it appears in listings.

## Using This Template with LLMs

- Start with the LLM Starter Prompt and fill in variables:
  - `lib/documents/LLM_STARTER_PROMPT.md`
- Agents must follow pnpm usage, dev server assumptions, and Astro best practices documented in this repo.
